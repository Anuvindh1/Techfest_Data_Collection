# How to Reset Winner Counts on Render (For Testing)

## ‚úÖ NEW: Admin Reset Endpoint

I've added a simple API endpoint that lets you reset all winner counts to 0, so you can test the 5-winner limit multiple times!

## Method 1: Using the Reset API Endpoint (Easiest) ‚≠ê

### Using cURL (Terminal/Command Line)

```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR-APP-NAME.onrender.com/api/admin/reset-winners \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"password":"test123"}'
```

**Replace:**
- `YOUR-APP-NAME` with your actual Render app name
- `test123` with your own password (you can change it in `server/routes.ts` line 152)

### Using Postman or Insomnia

1. **Method:** POST
2. **URL:** `https://YOUR-APP-NAME.onrender.com/api/admin/reset-winners`
3. **Headers:** 
   - Content-Type: `application/json`
4. **Body (JSON):**
   ```json
   {
     "password": "test123"
   }
   ```
5. **Click Send**

### Using Browser Console

1. Open your deployed app in browser
2. Press `F12` to open DevTools
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Paste and run:
   ```javascript
   fetch('/api/admin/reset-winners', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
     body: JSON.stringify({ password: 'test123' })
   })
   .then(r => r.json())
   .then(data => console.log(data));
   ```

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "‚úÖ Winner counts reset successfully!",
  "tip": "You can now test the 5-winner limit again",
  "events": [
    {"name": "What's In The Box", "currentWinners": 0, "maxWinners": 5},
    {"name": "Guess The Beat", "currentWinners": 0, "maxWinners": 5},
    // ... all 6 events
  ]
}
```

## Method 2: Using SQL Query (Direct Database Access)

### Via PSQL Command

1. **Go to your PostgreSQL Database in Render**
2. **Click "Info" tab**
3. **Copy and run the PSQL Command** in your terminal:
   ```bash
   PGPASSWORD=xxxxx psql -h dpg-xxxxx.singapore-postgres.render.com -U techfest_user techfest
   ```
4. **Run reset query:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE events SET current_winners = 0;
   ```
5. **Verify it worked:**
   ```sql
   SELECT name, current_winners, max_winners FROM events;
   ```
6. **Exit:**
   ```sql
   \q
   ```

### Via DBeaver (Visual Interface)

1. **Open DBeaver** and connect to your Render database
2. **Run SQL query:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE events SET current_winners = 0;
   ```
3. **Execute (F5 or Ctrl+Enter)**
4. **Verify in table view**

---

## Method 3: Using Render Shell

1. **Go to your Web Service in Render Dashboard**
2. **Click "Shell" tab**
3. **Wait for shell to connect** (10-20 seconds)
4. **Run:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```
   This resets the database schema, setting all winners to 0

## Testing the 5-Winner Limit

### Step-by-Step Test Process

1. **Reset winners using Method 1** (API endpoint)

2. **Manually set one event to 4 winners** (via PSQL or DBeaver):
   ```sql
   UPDATE events SET current_winners = 4 WHERE name = 'Balanzo';
   ```

3. **Have 5-10 people spin the wheel simultaneously**

4. **Expected result:**
   - Only 1 more person wins "Balanzo" (making it 5/5)
   - Everyone else gets "Better Luck Next Time"

5. **Verify in database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT name, current_winners, max_winners FROM events WHERE name = 'Balanzo';
   ```
   Should show: `current_winners = 5`

6. **Reset and test again** using the API endpoint!

## Security: Change the Reset Password

**IMPORTANT:** Before deploying to production, change the password!

### Steps to Change Password:

1. **Edit `server/routes.ts`** (line 152-155)
2. **Change from:**
   ```typescript
   if (password !== "test123") {
   ```
   **To:**
   ```typescript
   if (password !== "YOUR_SECRET_PASSWORD_HERE") {
   ```
3. **Commit and push to GitHub**
4. **Render will auto-deploy**

**Recommended passwords:**
- Make it at least 12 characters
- Include letters, numbers, and symbols
- Example: `VJ2025TechFest!Reset`

## When to Use Each Method

### üéØ Method 1 (API Endpoint) - Best for:
- ‚úÖ Quick testing during development
- ‚úÖ Resetting between test runs
- ‚úÖ Easy access from anywhere (just need the URL)
- ‚úÖ Can be called from code/scripts

### üéØ Method 2 (SQL Query) - Best for:
- ‚úÖ When you have database GUI open already
- ‚úÖ More advanced operations (like resetting specific events)
- ‚úÖ When you want to see data immediately

### üéØ Method 3 (Render Shell) - Best for:
- ‚úÖ Complete database reset
- ‚úÖ When other methods aren't working
- ‚úÖ Running migrations

## Quick Reference Commands

### Check Winner Counts
```sql
SELECT name, current_winners, max_winners FROM events ORDER BY current_winners DESC;
```

### Reset All Winners
```sql
UPDATE events SET current_winners = 0;
```

### Reset Specific Event
```sql
UPDATE events SET current_winners = 0 WHERE name = 'Balanzo';
```

### Count Total Winners
```sql
SELECT SUM(current_winners) as total_winners FROM events;
```

### Set Event to Almost Full (for testing)
```sql
UPDATE events SET current_winners = 4 WHERE name = 'What''s In The Box';
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized" Error
- Check you're using the correct password
- Password is case-sensitive
- Make sure JSON body is properly formatted

### "Failed to reset winners" Error
- Check database connection (look at web service logs)
- Ensure DATABASE_URL is set correctly
- Try Method 2 (SQL query) instead

### Changes Not Reflecting
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Verify reset actually happened in database
- Check web service logs for errors

## Production Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è REMOVE Reset Endpoint Before Event Day

For security, you may want to remove or disable the reset endpoint on event day:

**Option 1: Add environment variable check**
```typescript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  res.status(404).json({ message: "Not found" });
  return;
}
```

**Option 2: Comment out the endpoint**
Just comment out lines 146-173 in `server/routes.ts`

**Option 3: Keep it but use a strong password**
Change "test123" to a very strong password only you know

---

## Summary

**For testing the 5-winner limit on Render:**

1. ‚úÖ Use the `/api/admin/reset-winners` endpoint (fastest!)
2. ‚úÖ Reset as many times as you need
3. ‚úÖ Test with real people to verify concurrent handling
4. ‚úÖ Change the password before event day
5. ‚úÖ Consider disabling the endpoint for production

**You're all set to test thoroughly before your October 24th event!** üéâ
