# Winner Limit Verification - 5 Winners Per Game

## ✅ CONFIRMED: Winner Limits Work Correctly

Your application **correctly enforces** the 5-winner limit per game, even when deployed on Render with PostgreSQL. This protection works even with hundreds of concurrent users.

## How It Works

### 1. Database-Level Protection (Atomic Operation)

**File:** `server/storage-postgres.ts` (lines 62-76)

```typescript
async incrementEventWinners(eventId: string): Promise<void> {
  const result = await db
    .update(events)
    .set({ 
      currentWinners: sql`${events.currentWinners} + 1` 
    })
    .where(
      sql`${events.id} = ${eventId} AND ${events.currentWinners} < ${events.maxWinners}`
    )
    .returning();

  if (result.length === 0) {
    throw new Error(`Event ${eventId} has reached maximum winners`);
  }
}
```

**Why this is bulletproof:**
- ✅ **Atomic operation** - The database executes this as a single transaction
- ✅ **Conditional update** - Only increments if `currentWinners < maxWinners`
- ✅ **Race condition safe** - If 10 people spin at the exact same moment when there's 1 slot left, only 1 will win
- ✅ **Returns 0 rows** if limit reached, triggering the error

### 2. Application-Level Fallback

**File:** `server/routes.ts` (lines 84-126)

```typescript
// Filter events that still have available slots
const availableEvents = events.filter(
  (event) => event.currentWinners < event.maxWinners
);

// Try to increment winner count
try {
  await storage.incrementEventWinners(selectedEvent.id);
  result = selectedEvent.name;
  isWinner = true;
} catch (error) {
  // If quota reached, fallback to "Better Luck Next Time"
  result = "Better Luck Next Time";
}
```

**Protection layers:**
1. Pre-filters events to only include those with available slots
2. Attempts atomic increment
3. If increment fails (race condition), gracefully falls back to "Better Luck Next Time"

## Winner Distribution

### Current Settings
- **6 games** on the wheel
- **5 winners maximum** per game
- **30 total winners** maximum (6 games × 5 winners)
- **25% win probability** (1 in 4 participants)

### What Happens During Event

**Example scenario with 100 participants:**

1. **First 30-40 participants:**
   - About 25% (7-10 people) will win
   - Winners distributed across the 6 games

2. **Participants 40-80:**
   - Fewer slots available as games fill up
   - Win rate stays around 25% until events fill

3. **When all 30 slots are filled:**
   - Everyone after that gets "Better Luck Next Time"
   - System automatically stops awarding winners

## Testing the Limit

### Manual Test (Before Event)

**Test with friends/team:**

1. **Setup test scenario:**
   ```sql
   -- Set one event to 4 winners (1 slot left)
   UPDATE events SET current_winners = 4 WHERE id = 'event-1';
   ```

2. **Have 5-10 people spin simultaneously**
   - Only 1 more person should win "What's In The Box"
   - Everyone else gets "Better Luck Next Time"

3. **Verify in database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT name, current_winners, max_winners FROM events;
   ```
   - You should see exactly 5 winners for that event

### Automated Verification Query

**After your event, check winner counts:**

```sql
-- Check all events have ≤ 5 winners
SELECT 
  name, 
  current_winners, 
  max_winners,
  CASE 
    WHEN current_winners > max_winners THEN '❌ OVER LIMIT' 
    ELSE '✅ OK' 
  END as status
FROM events
ORDER BY current_winners DESC;
```

**Expected output:**
```
name                | current_winners | max_winners | status
--------------------|----------------|-------------|--------
What's In The Box   | 5              | 5           | ✅ OK
Guess The Beat      | 5              | 5           | ✅ OK
Byte The Basket     | 5              | 5           | ✅ OK
Memory Game         | 5              | 5           | ✅ OK
Cross Word Puzzle   | 5              | 5           | ✅ OK
Balanzo             | 5              | 5           | ✅ OK
```

## Why This Works on Render (PostgreSQL)

### PostgreSQL Transaction Guarantees

PostgreSQL provides **ACID** guarantees:
- **Atomic:** The update either succeeds completely or fails completely
- **Consistent:** Database always moves from one valid state to another
- **Isolated:** Concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other
- **Durable:** Once committed, data is permanent

### Race Condition Example

**Scenario:** 3 people spin when "Balanzo" has 4 winners (1 slot left)

```
Time    Person A              Person B              Person C
-------------------------------------------------------------------
T1      Checks: 4 < 5 ✓       
T2                            Checks: 4 < 5 ✓       
T3                                                  Checks: 4 < 5 ✓
T4      UPDATE (4→5) ✅       
T5                            UPDATE fails ❌        
T6                                                  UPDATE fails ❌
T7      Gets "Balanzo"        
T8                            Gets "Better Luck"    
T9                                                  Gets "Better Luck"
```

**Result:**
- Person A wins "Balanzo" (5/5 slots filled)
- Person B and C get "Better Luck Next Time"
- **No over-allocation possible!**

## Monitoring During Event

### Real-time Winner Count Check

**Using DBeaver or PSQL:**

```sql
-- Run this query during the event to monitor winners
SELECT 
  name,
  current_winners || '/' || max_winners as "Winners",
  ROUND((current_winners::float / max_winners) * 100) || '%' as "Filled"
FROM events
ORDER BY current_winners DESC;
```

**Example output during event:**
```
name                | Winners | Filled
--------------------|---------|-------
What's In The Box   | 5/5     | 100%
Guess The Beat      | 4/5     | 80%
Memory Game         | 3/5     | 60%
Byte The Basket     | 2/5     | 40%
Cross Word Puzzle   | 1/5     | 20%
Balanzo             | 0/5     | 0%
```

### Total Winners Check

```sql
-- Count total winners across all events
SELECT SUM(current_winners) as total_winners FROM events;

-- Should NEVER exceed 30
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### ✅ All Events Full (30 Winners)
- **What happens:** Everyone gets "Better Luck Next Time"
- **Code:** `availableEvents.length === 0` (line 101-103 in routes.ts)

### ✅ Some Events Full, Others Available
- **What happens:** Winners only assigned to events with slots
- **Code:** Filters to `availableEvents` before selection

### ✅ Simultaneous Spins (Race Condition)
- **What happens:** Database atomically allows only valid increments
- **Code:** PostgreSQL transaction isolation handles this

### ✅ Server Restart Mid-Event
- **What happens:** Winner counts persist in PostgreSQL
- **Code:** Data stored in database, not memory

## Post-Event Verification

### Winner Report Query

```sql
-- Generate complete winner report
SELECT 
  e.name as event_name,
  e.current_winners as winner_count,
  e.max_winners as max_allowed,
  ARRAY_AGG(p.name) as winners
FROM events e
LEFT JOIN participants p ON p.spin_result = e.name
GROUP BY e.id, e.name, e.current_winners, e.max_winners
ORDER BY e.current_winners DESC;
```

### Export All Winners

```sql
-- Export list of all winners with contact info
\copy (
  SELECT 
    p.name as participant_name, 
    p.phone, 
    p.spin_result as event_won,
    to_timestamp(p.timestamp/1000) as won_at
  FROM participants p
  WHERE p.spin_result IS NOT NULL 
    AND p.spin_result != 'Better Luck Next Time'
  ORDER BY p.timestamp
) TO 'all_winners.csv' CSV HEADER;
```

## Deployment Checklist for Winner Limits

### Before Deploying to Render

- ✅ Verify `maxWinners: 5` in both storage files
- ✅ Check PostgreSQL atomic increment logic
- ✅ Ensure `NODE_ENV=production` uses PostgreSQL, not memory storage

### After Deploying to Render

- ✅ Run test spins and verify winner counts in database
- ✅ Check logs show "PostgreSQL database connected successfully!"
- ✅ Query database to confirm all events initialized with 0 winners
- ✅ Test with 10-15 people before event day

### During Event

- ✅ Monitor winner counts in real-time using DBeaver
- ✅ Watch for any event reaching 5/5 winners
- ✅ Check logs for any database errors

### After Event

- ✅ Verify no event exceeded 5 winners
- ✅ Export winner data for prizes/certificates
- ✅ Backup database before 90-day expiry

## Summary

**Your winner limit implementation is production-ready!** ✅

- ✅ Database-level atomic operations prevent over-allocation
- ✅ Application-level fallback handles edge cases
- ✅ Works correctly with concurrent users on Render
- ✅ PostgreSQL guarantees data consistency
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

**You can confidently deploy this to Render knowing each game will have exactly 5 winners maximum!**
